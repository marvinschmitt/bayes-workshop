Please follow the instructions in this document to make sure that everything works as expected. First and foremost, please download the .qmd file so that you can execute the installation steps. Open the downloaded file index.qmd in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Download the .qmd file for the setup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDo not hit Render yet, the installation commands might cause errors. Instead, execute the code in the cells by navigating your cursor to a line and hitting Ctrl+Enter (Cmd+Enter on Mac).\nOnce you have installed all packages, you can go ahead and hit Render once to get a pretty output file.\n\n\n\n\nLet’s see if the basic R functionality works as expected.\n\nx = 5\ny = 2\nz = x + y\nprint(z)\n\n[1] 7\n\nw = sqrt(z)\nprint(w)\n\n[1] 2.645751\n\n\nAwesome, let’s install some key packages for working in R!"

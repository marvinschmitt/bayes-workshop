# Welcome!

This workshop teaches the basics of Bayesian statistics. We start with an overview of the basic principles and concepts. After a solid understanding of the theory, participants will have the opportunity to apply their knowledge through hands-on experience with R. This workshop provides a comprehensive and interactive learning environment that offers both theoretical insights and practical skills. We use the `brms` interface to the probabilistic programming language Stan for Bayesian inference.

## Prior knowledge

- Basic training in (frequentist) statistics: e.g. from psychology studies
- Basic knowledge of R: installing packages, reading and manipulating data, regression analysis with `lm()`

## Language

Workshop language is German, materials are written in English.

## Instructor

The workshop is instructed by [Marvin Schmitt](https://www.marvinschmitt.com).

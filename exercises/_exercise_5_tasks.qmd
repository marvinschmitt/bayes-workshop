## IMDB movie ratings: Effect size and ROPE

#. Compute the posterior distribution of Cohen's $d$ for the movie genre comparison
#. Define a sensible region of practical equivalence (ROPE) for Cohen's $d$
#. Choose a sensible credible interval for reporting the posterior distribution of Cohen's $d$
#. Visualize the ROPE and the posterior credible interval of $d$
#. Interpret the result
#. **Optional:** Change the model family to *Student-t*. 
    * Find out which additional parameter this will model, add a prior for it.
    * Should we model the data with a Student-$t$ family?

## Multilevel model for icecream sales

#. Define more Bayesian models, and save each model in a separate variable for later.
    #. `icecream_mlm_2`: Change the likelihood to a `Poisson` distribution
    #. `icecream_mlm_3`: Allow for varying slopes at each location but a fixed intercept
    #. `icecream_mlm_4`: Allow for varying slopes and varying intercept at each location
#. Compare the models via LOO-CV
    * You need `loo()` and `loo_compare()`
#. Interpret the results. What are your conclusions?

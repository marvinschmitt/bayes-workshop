## Hints

### Multilevel model in `brms` (Intercept-only)

```{r}
#| eval: False

icecream_mlm_1 = brm(
  units ~ temp + (1 | location),
  data = icecream2,
  control = list(adapt_delta = 0.99)
)
```

### Individual slope per location

- How is the location encoded in the `icecream_mlm_1` formula?
- Who would get an individual slope in the *individual slope* model?
